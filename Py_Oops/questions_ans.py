1 > Why is Python called an OOPS language?

-- > Because in Python EVERYTHING is an object

    -- >"hello" >  data
        .upper() > function (method)
        Data + Method = Object

-- > Python is an object-oriented language because everything in Python is treated as 
     an object and it supports all OOPS concepts like 
     1. class, 
     2. object,    
        3. inheritance, 
        4. encapsulation, 
        4. polymorphism,
        5. abstraction.

2 > Advantages of OOPS

-- > OOPS improves reusability, security, maintainability, scalability, and overall code quality.

-- > OOPS provides better data security using encapsulation and data hiding, ensuring controlled access to data. 
-- > It allows flexibility and scalability through polymorphism, making it easy to modify or add new features without
    affecting existing code. 
-- > OOPS also enables developers to create their own custom data types using classes, which helps in modeling 
    real-world problems more effectively.

    
    -- > you can creat your own datatype 
    -- > like a = x ,  b = y 
    -- > then print( a + b) --- > return the  xy 

    but logically we want x + y   --- > so we can creat oue owe datatype :  ok
